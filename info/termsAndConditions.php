Only one entry per round is allowed per person.

            <p><h4>The Competition</h4></p>
            <ol>
                <li>To take part in the Total Touchdown Competition, a player must predict the touchdown result for all five selected Total Touchdown NFL games. A further prediction of the total number of touchdowns scored in the first quarter in all 5 games is required. This will act as a tie-breaker.</li>
                <li>The Competition runs for 17 weeks over the course of the NFL season. Players can enter for as little or as many weeks as they choose to.</li>
                <li>Points will be scored as follows. Players will receive:<br>
                    5 points for each correct score prediction, or<br>
                    2 points for predicting the correct number of touchdowns from one team.<br><br>
                    Players will not score points for correctly predicting the number of touchdowns scored in the first quarter. This prediction will only be used to determine winners in the case of a tie-breaker.</p></li>
                <li>Players will be awarded points weekly and will be entered into a leaderboard. A prize of £10,000 will be awarded to the player with the most points at the end of the NFL season. If two or more players are tied on points at the top of the leaderboard at the end of the season, the jackpot will be split amongst those players equally.</li>
                <li>Total Touchdown selections must be submitted before the deadline to be in with a chance to win. The deadline for predictions each week will be 1 hour before the official scheduled kick off time of the Total Touchdown games. All Total Touchdown kick off times can be found on the prediction page. Once an entry has been submitted, it can be changed up until the deadline.</li>
                <li>If a game is abandoned, no points can be scored from any predictions made for that game.</li>
                <li>Predictions for the following weeks' Competition round can be made as soon as all of the Total Touchdown games have finished.</li>
                <li>To win the Total Touchdown Competition Jackpot Prize of £250,000 (unless otherwise specified), a player must correctly predict the touchdown scores of all five of the Total Touchdown games. If the jackpot is won by multiple entrants, the tie breaker will be used to select the winner. The £250,000 prize (unless otherwise specified) can only be won if all five Total Touchdown games are played (no abandoned games).</li>
                <li>All cash prizes are non-transferable.</li>
                <li>The Promoter reserves the right to substitute the prize (or any part of the prize) for a prize of equivalent or greater monetary value if this is necessary for reasons beyond its control.</li>
                <li>The Promoter will not be liable for prizes that do not reach the winners for reasons beyond its reasonable control.
